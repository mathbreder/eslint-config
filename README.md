# mathbreder's ESLint config

## Whats included?

- Standard config base;
- Prettier;

## Setup

Requires ESLint 9 (flat config). The package exports `eslintConfigs` (presets) and `getEslintImportConfig` (import rules).

Install the package together with the peer dependencies listed in its `package.json`:
```
pnpm add -D @mathbreder/eslint-config
```

Create `eslint.config.mjs` in the project:
```js
import { eslintConfigs, getEslintImportConfig } from '@mathbreder/eslint-config';

export default eslintConfigs.defineConfig([
  ...eslintConfigs.baseConfig,
  ...getEslintImportConfig({
    project: './tsconfig.json',
    pathGroups: [
      { pattern: '@app/**', group: 'internal' },
      { pattern: '@shared/**', group: 'internal' },
    ],
    noUnresolvedIgnore: ['^virtual:'],
  }),
]);
```

Presets available in `eslintConfigs`:

- `baseConfig`: TypeScript, stylistic and perfectionist rules, plus general ESLint rules.
- `reactNextConfig`: React, React Hooks, JSX a11y and JSX rules. Apply it to React projects.
- `expoConfig`: Expo defaults.

### `getEslintImportConfig(options?)`

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `project` | `string \| string[]` | `<cwd>/tsconfig.json` | tsconfig(s) used by `eslint-import-resolver-typescript`. Accepts globs, for example `packages/*/tsconfig.json`. |
| `pathGroups` | `PathGroup[]` | `[]` | Extra groups for `import/order`, added after the default `react` group. |
| `noUnresolvedIgnore` | `string[]` | `[]` | Regex patterns for modules that `import/no-unresolved` should accept without resolution, for example virtual modules. |

`PathGroup` is `{ pattern: string; group: ImportGroup; position?: 'before' | 'after' }`.

Aliases are not ignored by default: an alias declared in `tsconfig.json` is resolved, and an alias that does not exist is reported. Use `noUnresolvedIgnore` only for justified exceptions.

### Notable rules

- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` reports unused arguments, variables and caught errors. Names starting with `_` are ignored, and rest siblings in destructuring are ignored.
- `@stylistic/indent` uses 2 spaces, one level for arrays and function bodies, and aligns parameters to the first one. Class properties are ignored.
- `react/jsx-indent` checks indentation inside `&&` and ternary expressions in JSX.
- `react/display-name` (warn) requires a name only for anonymous components. Named components, including those created with `const X = () => ...`, are accepted. For `memo` and `forwardRef`, name the inner function:
  ```js
  export const Input = forwardRef(function Input(props, ref) { /* ... */ });
  ```
  Setting `displayName` manually is also accepted.
- `max-lines-per-function` is set to 80 lines, ignoring blank lines and comments. Test files are exempt.
- `eqeqeq` requires strict comparison (`===`/`!==`), including with `null`. Use `value === null || value === undefined` instead of `value == null`.
- `no-unsafe-optional-chaining` also reports arithmetic on optional chains (`usuario?.saldo * 2`). Provide an explicit fallback that matches your business rule, for example `(usuario?.saldo ?? 0) * 2`.
- TypeScript rules enabled individually from `typescript-eslint` (not the full preset): `ban-ts-comment` (descriptions of at least 10 characters), `no-array-constructor`, `no-duplicate-enum-values`, `no-non-null-asserted-optional-chain`, `no-unsafe-declaration-merging`, `no-unsafe-function-type`, `no-unused-expressions`, `prefer-as-const`, `prefer-namespace-keyword`, `no-misused-new`, `triple-slash-reference`, `no-extra-non-null-assertion` and `no-wrapper-object-types`.
- `prefer-rest-params` and `prefer-spread` are enabled.

### Inherited from presets

- `js.configs.recommended` (`@eslint/js`) supplies the core ESLint error rules, such as `no-cond-assign`, `no-unreachable` and `no-useless-escape`. The config does not repeat them.
- `react-hooks` recommended supplies `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` (error) and `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` (warn). Custom hook names are not set globally; configure `react-hooks` in the project when needed.

### Known conflicts

- `export default () => <div />` triggers `react/display-name` (warn). The config sets `react/function-component-definition` to `unnamedComponents: 'arrow-function'`, so anonymous arrow components are not reported as errors.
- Malformed JSX indentation is reported by both `@stylistic/indent` and `react/jsx-indent`, so the same error appears twice. Both rules expect the same indentation, so there is no contradiction. This duplication is accepted.

## Tests

```
pnpm test
```

Runs `pnpm run build` and then the tests in `tests/`. The tests use the ESLint API against the built output. They cover the no-unused-vars options, stylistic indentation, the max function length, the recommended and TypeScript rules (valid and invalid examples in `.js` and `.ts`), `import/order`, `import/no-unresolved`, JSX indentation, `react/display-name`, React Hooks, and the effective severities of inherited rules.
